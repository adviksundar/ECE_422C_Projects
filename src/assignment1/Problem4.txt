/* Student Name: Advik Sundar, Lab Section: 17270 */

In this class, I would expect to learn about more about the deeper concepts in object oriented programming as well as get better skilled at solving harder programming problems (especially problems that are harder than the ones we received in ECE 312). I would also like to have better mastery in all the different data structures (e.g. graphs, hash maps, queues, etc.) and learn to apply my skills in programming to greater heights (e.g. creating a UI, doing machine learning, etc.). That being said, if we have time at the end of the semester to go through additional topics related to software engineering, I would go over JavaFX, creating a full-stack app using Java, and even learning concepts related to how Java is actually applied in companies like Google. We can even get exposed to more languages like Python or Rust if we have the time.
