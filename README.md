This repo is filled with Java projects that I did during my time in UT Austin's Software Implementation and Design II Course (ECE 422C). These projects range from integrating an NLP Part of Speech tagging tool from Stanford's Maxent Tagger, designing the classic "Mastermind" game, designing an AI Poetry writer using graphs, and upgrading the Mastermind video game to a client-server online game where multiple clients from around the world can play with each other!
